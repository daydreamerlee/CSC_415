# CSC415 HW5

### Part1
Update the code for homework 4 to use a one-dimensional global array to hold all of the character counts, so that all the threads increment the same array entries without using any synchronization. Then create a second version that protects the increment of the global array using a mutex. Run both versions on the same file and compare the character counts. Which are larger? Why? 

####*Race condition without mutexï¼š*
```c
void *ascii_counting (void* thread){
    char current_char;
    int t,thread_begin_location;
    thread_info *td= (thread_info*) thread;

    t = td->thread_id;
    thread_begin_location= t * td->partition_bounds;
   
    for (int i = 0; i < td->partition_bounds; ++i)
    {
        /* code */
        current_char = char_buffer[thread_begin_location+i];
        ascii_num[(int)current_char]++;
    }
    pthread_exit(0);
}
```
####*Sync condition with mutex:*
```c
void *ascii_counting (void* thread){
    char current_char;
    int t,thread_begin_location;

    thread_info *td= (thread_info*) thread;

    t = td->thread_id;
    thread_begin_location= t * td->partition_bounds;
    for (int i = 0; i < td->partition_bounds; ++i)
    {
        /* code */
        current_char = char_buffer[thread_begin_location+i];
        pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
        ascii_num[(int)current_char]++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
    }
    pthread_exit(0);
}
```

511822 occurrences of 0xc            524856 occurrences of 0xc     524856 occurrences of 0xc
512844 occurrences of 0xd            524868 occurrences of 0xd     524868 occurrences of 0xd
```
Race condition will make the result smaller, because race condition will lose the update of the mutual accessed buffer, making some counting result lost.This will make the final count smaller.

### Part2
####*Consumer producer problem*

- Use condition variable `ready_to_read` and `ready_to_write` and mutex lock.
- Buffer is a cycle array, with size of 16.
- The number of producers, the number of consumers, and the number of items each producer produces should be specified by their binary log as command-line parameters. In the following example, there are 2 producers, with each produce 16 items, and 4 consumers,each consuming 16*2/4=8 items.

        ./run 1 2 4

- Producer produce integer numbers, from **thread_number * num_produced** to **thread_number * num_produced+ total_to_be_produced**
- Consumer consume the numbers by simply print them out.

Code is shown as an appendix.
